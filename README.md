# Terrain Generator OpenGL Project
This is my attempt to make a simple 3D terrain generator using OpenGL. The project is still a work in progress but here are the milestones achieved so far:
- Rendering simple mesh
- Loading and rendering a heightmap file
- Texturing the terrain
- Blending multiple textures together based on height values

Here are some things that I want to continue to work on and add in the future:
- Procedural generation
- Lighting
- Skybox
- UI
